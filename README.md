# NeuroAkinator

A mini project for the class I am taking this summer (S2024 Term 1): Psychology 304 at UBC.
This class focuses on Brain and Behaviour, and through this mini project, I aim to make a very simple Akinator that hopes to guess the type of visualization technique one is thinking of 
based on a series of 'yes' and 'no' questions. The visualization techniques considered are just those we have learned in class.
